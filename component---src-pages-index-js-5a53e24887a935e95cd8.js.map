walk through an AST using a depth first traversal, calling\n\t * the visitor's enter function at each node in the traversal, and calling the\n\t * leave function after visiting that node and all of its child nodes.\n\t *\n\t * By returning different values from the enter and leave functions, the\n\t * behavior of the visitor can be altered, including skipping over a sub-tree of\n\t * the AST (by returning false), editing the AST by returning a value or null\n\t * to remove the value, or to stop the whole traversal by returning BREAK.\n\t *\n\t * When using visit() to edit an AST, the original AST will not be modified, and\n\t * a new version of the AST with the changes applied will be returned from the\n\t * visit function.\n\t *\n\t *     const editedAST = visit(ast, {\n\t *       enter(node, key, parent, path, ancestors) {\n\t *         // @return\n\t *         //   undefined: no action\n\t *         //   false: skip visiting this node\n\t *         //   visitor.BREAK: stop visiting altogether\n\t *         //   null: delete this node\n\t *         //   any value: replace this node with the returned value\n\t *       },\n\t *       leave(node, key, parent, path,

visitors that trigger upon entering and leaving a node of\n\t *    a specific kind.\n\t *\n\t *     visit(ast, {\n\t *       Kind: {\n\t *         enter(node) {\n\t *           // enter the \"Kind\"
